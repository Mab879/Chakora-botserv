             INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------

Currently Chakora supports:

` InspIRCd 1.2
` ircd-ratbox with use_ts6 set to yes
` Charybdis and IRCd's based off of it. [that only have the +ov modes - e.g. not ShadowIRCd] (ircd-seven, darkhex, etc.) - For all these put charybdis


Follow these steps to install Chakora;

./configure

If all required CPAN modules are there, you're ready to begin your journey with Chakora :).

Remember to edit etc/chakora.conf, etc/modules.conf, and etc/soper.conf.
(Note: Logging flags do not work at the moment.)
