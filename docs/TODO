	[X] Don't allow OperServ to be kicked/killed/etc. (Add the reconnection stuff in raw_ subs? --Matthew)
	[X] Restart
	[X] Shutdown
	[ ] Rehash (Config::Scoped doesn't allow this, we need our own config parser --Matthew)
	[X] Module management (list, load, unload) [list done, somethings wrong with load and unload - perhaps module_exists is bugged --Matthew] 
	[ ] Make modload, modunload and protocols - unloadable ( protocols don't have a void/init handler, regardless, let it be known it's not unloadable --Matthew)
 	[ ] Improve the error messages in modload, if the file doesn't exist say that.
	[X] The protocols need to be a module (Add $Chakora::MODULE{name} $Chakora::MODULE{author} and $Chakora::MODULE{version} to the top of the protocol --Matthew)

 	[X] InspIRCd: find a way to properly tell if a user is an oper
	[X] Charybdis: find a way to properly tell if a user is an oper 
	[X] Add serv_jupe (InspIRCd's module still lacks this, developers who can create some sort of SID generator and check if its in use, go for it --Matthew)
	[X] InspIRCd: strip modes on a user in FJOIN (I was stupid, it already did that --Matthew)
	[X] Charybdis: Oper regex needs fixed (for one +a isn't always applied, also +o isn't the only mode, so the current one won't work --Matthew)
	[X] InspIRCd: Add raw_motd and raw_admin
	[X] Add serv_accoutname

	[ ] TS6-generic support.
	[+] P10-generic support.
	[ ] A server doesn't need to exist to add a jupe, but we still need to check if a server that is trying to be juped exists. Fix the $ssid in the protocols to do this.
	[ ] InspIRCd: Handle remote servers trying to set a users accountname like Charybdis
[ ] Docs
	[X] Add docs for the module api
	[!] Improve module api docs (add sidInfo and uidInfo for one)
[ ] Other
	[X] Allow custom services to be made and handled like others
	[ ] When chanserv/flags is done, add the +L flag creation there
	[ ] Make our own config parser, we really need one.
	[!] Fix the truckload of uninitialized values issues that are displayed while in debug mode.
