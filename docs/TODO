                 TODO
----------------------------------------

[ ] Global
	[ ] send_global sub (Use a foreach statement for %uid's to send a NOTICE to each user?)

	[!] Register
	[ ] Group
	[ ] Identify
	[ ] Drop
	[ ] Enforce
	[ ] Set

	[ ] Group
	[ ] Request
[ ] Core
	[X] Add module_void
	[X] Add ctcp_reply
	[ ] Add module_is_loadable (check if the file exists perhaps?)
	[ ] Improve CTCP handling (make add_ctcp_handler and del_ctcp_handler perhaps?)
	[ ] Add is_oper (This is easy in InspIRCd, not in Charybids)
[ ] Protocols
	[X] Add serv_kill
	[ ] Add serv_enforce
	[ ] Add function to hold nicknames
	[ ] Charybdis: find a way to properly tell if a user is an oper 
	[!] Add serv_jupe (InspIRCd's module still lacks this, developers who can create some sort of SID generator and check if its in us, go for it --Matthew)
	[X] InspIRCd: strip modes on a user in FJOIN (I was stupid, it already did that --Matthew)

Key: 
	X = Done
	! = In development
	? = Still being questioned whether it should be in Chakora or not
