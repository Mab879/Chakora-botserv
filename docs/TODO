                 TODO
----------------------------------------

[ ] Global
	[ ] send_global sub (Use a foreach statement for %uid's to send a NOTICE to each user? --Matthew)
[ ] NickServ
	[!] Register
	[ ] Group
	[ ] Identify
	[ ] Drop
	[ ] Enforce
	[ ] Set
	[ ] Ghost
	[ ] Release
	[X] Account name 
[ ] ChanServ
	[ ] Register
	[ ] Drop
	[ ] Set (Founder, Successor, Restricted, Topiclock)
	[ ] Access list system (We're going to do a flag system with an XOP adapter)	
[ ] MemoServ
	[ ] Send
	[ ] List
	[ ] Read
	[ ] Delete
[ ] OperServ
	[ ] Restart
	[ ] Shutdown
	[ ] Rehash
	[ ] Module management (list, info, load, unload)
	[ ] AKill
	[ ] Jupe
	[ ] Global (Obviously we need to finish send_global first)
	[ ] Logonnews (Add a hook using hook_uid_add, sending a( ) notice(s) to users on connect? --Matthew)
[ ] HostServ
	[ ] Set vHosts
	[ ] Delete vHost
	[ ] Group
	[ ] Request
	[?] On/Off 
[ ] Core
	[X] Add module_void
	[X] Add ctcp_reply
	[ ] Add module_is_loadable (check if the file exists perhaps?)
	[ ] Improve CTCP handling (make add_ctcp_handler and del_ctcp_handler perhaps?)
	[ ] Add is_oper (This is easy in InspIRCd, not in Charybdis)
[ ] Protocols
	[X] Add serv_kill
	[ ] Add serv_enforce
	[ ] Add function to hold nicknames
 	[ ] Charybdis: find a way to properly tell if a user is an oper 
	[!] Add serv_jupe (InspIRCd's module still lacks this, developers who can create some sort of SID generator and check if its in us, go for it --Matthew)
	[X] InspIRCd: strip modes on a user in FJOIN (I was stupid, it already did that --Matthew)
[ ] Docs
	[ ] Add docs for the module api

Key: 
	X = Done
	! = In development
	? = Still being questioned whether it should be in Chakora or not
