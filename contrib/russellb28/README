AND MAY F**K UP YOUR INSTALLATION IF NOT USED CORRECTLY OR IF BUGS ARE EXPLOITED.

With that said, you are more than welcome to email me at russell@surgehost.net regarding

1. CURRENT MODULES
----------

Chakora's Contrib Modules in this section are developed by 
Russell Bradford (RussellB28) and made specifically to work
with the Chakora.

The Current Modules in this directory are:

* operserv/kill	- Kill Users from the Server via OperServ
* utilserv/*		- A whole new service providing useful non-irc related utilities
* chanserv/speak	- Send Messages or Actions to a Channel via ChanServ
* dnsbl/*		- A whole new service providing the ability to kill users that are listed in dns blacklists


2. INSTALLATION
---------------

There is no real specific installation method but i recommend the following method since
it works better and is likely to cause less issues.

1.	Moved the contrib files into /modules/X/ - where X represents ChanServ, OperServ etc...
	Use the module prefix (e.g "os_") to determine where the module should be placed.
2.	Rename the file so that the prefix of the file name is removed,
	(e.g os_akill.pm would become kill.pm)
3.	Added the module into /etc/modules.conf (e.g kill.pm would be 'operserv/kill' in the
	config)
4.	Load Services OR if you really want to load the module RIGHT NOW, use OperServ's MODLOAD
	command (e.g /msg OperServ MODLOAD operserv/kill)

3. MODULE INFORMATION
---------------

All the modules in this section are not supported officially by Chakora and while i will try to
ensure all of them work and dont cause issues with anyones installations, there is no guarantee
that there may not be exploitable bugs or issues that could corrupt databases or generally mess
up services.


***** 3.1 operserv/kill

This module allows operators to kill a user on the server either with or without a reason. This
module could be considered abusive on some networks so please use it with caution!

Commands Added:	KILL
Syntax:		/msg OperServ KILL [nickname] [reason]
Expected Output:	User is killed from Server with a Message

If a reason is specified for the kill reason, the message will look like:
* Quit (Killed (OperServ (Kill Reason Here)))
Otherwise, this message will be shown:
* Quit (Killed (OperServ (KILL command used by nickname!ident@host.name)))

Currently any user with OperServ access can use this module.

***** 3.2 utilserv/*

UtilServ allows users to use a variety of non irc related commands to do simple tasks such 
as looking up dns records, getting the local time from our server and many more useful features.

SEE 'utilserv/README' for more information!

***** 3.3 chanserv/speak

This module allows channel users to use commands that will make chanserv send messages
or actions to a given channel. This module adds its own flags known as 'B'. If the user
has the 'B' flag in a channel, they will be able to use the 'say' and 'act' commands 
otherwise they will recieve permission denied.

Commands Added:	SAY, ACT
Syntax:		/msg ChanServ SAY [channel] [message], /msg ChanServ ACT [channel] [message]
Expected Output:	Message sent to Channel as Message/Action

Currently any user with ChanServ access and flags 'B' on the channel specified in the
command can use this command successfully.

***** 3.4 dnsbl/*

DNSBL checks user's IP addresses against a long and comprehensive list of databases to check 
if the ip is blacklisted. If the IP is blacklisted, the user is killed
from the network explaining what list their ip is in and the reason number that goes with it. 
This Module is highly useful for blocking proxies and botnets.

SEE 'dnsbl/README' for more information!
