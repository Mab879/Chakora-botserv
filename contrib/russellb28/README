PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY MODULES IN THIS SECTION ARE NOT SUPPORTED OFFICIALLY BY CHAKORA
AND MAY F**K UP YOUR INSTALLATION IF NOT USED CORRECTLY OR IF BUGS ARE EXPLOITED.

With that said, you are more than welcome to email me at russell@surgehost.net regarding
these modules and i will happily fix any major bugs or add minor features that you request

1. CURRENT MODULES
----------

Chakora's Contrib Modules in this section are developed by 
Russell Bradford (RussellB28) and made specifically to work
with the Chakora.

The Current Modules in this directory are:

* operserv/kill	- Kill Users from the Server via OperServ
* operserv/dns	- Perform DNS Queries via OperServ
* chanserv/speak	- Send Messages or Actions to a Channel via ChanServ
* chanserv/mode	- Send Modes on a Channel via ChanServ


2. INSTALLATION
---------------

There is no real specific installation method but i recommend the following method since
it works better and is likely to cause less issues.

1.	Moved the contrib files into /modules/X/ - where X represents ChanServ, OperServ etc...
	Use the module prefix (e.g "os_") to determine where the module should be placed.
2.	Rename the file so that the prefix of the file name is removed,
	(e.g os_akill.pm would become kill.pm)
3.	Added the module into /etc/modules.conf (e.g kill.pm would be 'operserv/kill' in the
	config)
4.	Load Services OR if you really want to load the module RIGHT NOW, use OperServ's MODLOAD
	command (e.g /msg OperServ MODLOAD operserv/kill)

3. MODULE INFORMATION
---------------

All the modules in this section are not supported officially by Chakora and while i will try to
ensure all of them work and dont cause issues with anyones installations, there is no guarantee
that there may not be exploitable bugs or issues that could corrupt databases or generally mess
up services.


***** 3.1 operserv/kill

This module allows operators to kill a user on the server either with or without a reason. This
module could be considered abusive on some networks so please use it with caution!

Commands Added:	KILL
Syntax:		/msg OperServ KILL [nickname] [reason]
Expected Output:	User is killed from Server with a Message

If a reason is specified for the kill reason, the message will look like:
* Quit (Killed (OperServ (Kill Reason Here)))
Otherwise, this message will be shown:
* Quit (Killed (OperServ (KILL command used by nickname!ident@host.name)))

Currently any user with OperServ access can use this module.

***** 3.2 operserv/dns

This module allows operators to lookup IP, NameServer and Mail records for a given
hostname. This module probably has no usage and was mainly developed to demonstrate
how Chakora can interact with other CPAN Modules to provide more functionality in
modules.

Commands Added:	DNS
Syntax:		/msg OperServ KILL [domain] [type (A/NS/MX)]
Expected Output:	A List of Records is returned based on Domain and Type

Currently any user with OperServ access can use this module.

***** 3.3 chanserv/speak

This module allows channel users to use commands that will make chanserv send messages
or actions to a given channel. This module adds its own flags known as 'B'. If the user
has the 'B' flag in a channel, they will be able to use the 'say' and 'act' commands 
otherwise they will recieve permission denied.

Commands Added:	SAY, ACT
Syntax:		/msg ChanServ SAY [channel] [message], /msg ChanServ ACT [channel] [message]
Expected Output:	Message sent to Channel as Message/Action

Currently any user with ChanServ access and flags 'B' on the channel specified in the
command can use this command successfully.

***** 3.4 chanserv/mode

This module allows channel users to use commands that will make chanserv set modes on
a specified channel. If the user has the 's' flag in a channel, they will be able to use the 
'MODE' commands to set modes on a channel otherwise they will recieve permission denied.
This feature is most useful when you are operating a freenode style channel where users only
have voice but need the ability to set modes.

Commands Added:	MODE
Syntax:		/msg ChanServ MODE [channel] [modes]
Expected Output:	Modes are set on the designated channel

Currently any user with ChanServ access and flags 's' on the channel specified in the
command can use this command successfully.
