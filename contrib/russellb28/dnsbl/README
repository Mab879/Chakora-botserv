1. ABOUT DNSBL
----------

DNSBL checks user's IP addresses against a long
and comprehensive list of databases to check if the ip is
blacklisted. If the IP is blacklisted, the user is killed
from the network explaining what list their ip is in and
the reason number that goes with it. This Module is highly useful
for blocking proxies and botnets.

2. REQUIRED CONFIG CHANGES
---------------

To install and use this module, you will need to make some changes to 2 of Chakora's config files.
Below are the file names and the changes that need to be made.

First, you will need to move this entire directory named 'utilserv' into the 'modules' directory else
nothing is gonna work otherwise! Next do the following:

* FILE: /etc/chakora.conf
* ADD THE FOLLOWING LINES:
				dnsbl {
					nick = DNSBL
					user = DNSBL
					host = SurgeHost/Beta/Services/DNSBL
					real = "DNS Blacklist Services"
				}

* FILE: /etc/modules.conf
* ADD THE FOLLOWING LINES:
				load "dnsbl/main";
				load "dnsbl/help";

3. MODULE INFORMATION
---------------

All the modules in this section are not supported officially by Chakora and while i will try to
ensure all of them work and dont cause issues with anyones installations, there is no guarantee
that there may not be exploitable bugs or issues that could corrupt databases or generally mess
up services. THE MODULES IN THIS SECTION ALSO ONLY WORK WITH DNSBL!!
