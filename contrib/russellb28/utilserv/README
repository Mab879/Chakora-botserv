***** 3.1 utilserv/dns

This module allows users to lookup IP, NameServer and Mail records for a given
hostname. This module probably has no usage and was mainly developed to demonstrate
how Chakora can interact with other CPAN Modules to provide more functionality in
modules.

Commands Added:	DNS
Syntax:		/msg UtilServ KILL [domain] [type (A/NS/MX)]
Expected Output:	A List of Records is returned based on Domain and Type

Currently any user on the network can access can use this module.
