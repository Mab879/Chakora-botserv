1. ABOUT UTILSERV
----------

UtilServ allows users to use a variety of non irc related commands to do simple tasks such 
as looking up dns records, getting the local time from our server and many more useful features.

The Current Modules in this directory are:

* utilserv/dns	- Perform DNS Queries 
* utilserv/time	- Show the Current Date & Time 


2. REQUIRED CONFIG CHANGES
---------------

To install and use this module, you will need to make some changes to 2 of Chakora's config files.
Below are the file names and the changes that need to be made.

First, you will need to move this entire directory named 'utilserv' into the 'modules' directory else
nothing is gonna work otherwise! Next do the following:

* FILE: /etc/chakora.conf
* ADD THE FOLLOWING LINES:
				utilserv {
					nick = UtilServ
					user = UtilServ
					host = SurgeHost/Beta/Services/UtilServ
					real = "Utility Services"
				}

* FILE: /etc/modules.conf
* ADD THE FOLLOWING LINES:
				load "utilserv/main";
				load "utilserv/dns";
				load "utilserv/time";
				load "utilserv/help";


3. MODULE INFORMATION
---------------

All the modules in this section are not supported officially by Chakora and while i will try to
ensure all of them work and dont cause issues with anyones installations, there is no guarantee
that there may not be exploitable bugs or issues that could corrupt databases or generally mess
up services. THE MODULES IN THIS SECTION ALSO ONLY WORK WITH UTILSERV!!


***** 3.1 utilserv/dns

This module allows users to lookup IP, NameServer and Mail records for a given
hostname. This module probably has no usage and was mainly developed to demonstrate
how Chakora can interact with other CPAN Modules to provide more functionality in
modules.

Commands Added:	DNS
Syntax:		/msg UtilServ KILL [domain] [type (A/NS/MX)]
Expected Output:	A List of Records is returned based on Domain and Type

Currently any user on the network can access can use this module.

***** 3.2 utilserv/time

This module makes use of perls localtime function and will output the current date
and time. Note that the current date and time is the servers current date and time
and not the clients.

Commands Added:	TIME
Syntax:		/msg UtilServ TIME
Expected Output:	The Current Date & Time

Currently any user on the network can access can use this module.
