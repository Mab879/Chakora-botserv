serv_(service name, data)
   Destructive function for sending raw data to the server.

   This will send the given data to the server from the given services client
   BYPASSING all of Chakora's handlers.  WARNING: This is very dangerous, if
   there is a serv_* handler for the command you wish to send, PLEASE USE IT
   INSTEAD, otherwise, you risk desyncing Chakora unless you put it back in
   sync MANUALLY.
